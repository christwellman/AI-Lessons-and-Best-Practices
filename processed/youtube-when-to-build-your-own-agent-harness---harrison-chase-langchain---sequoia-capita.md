## Summary

Building AI agents requires owning three main components: the model, the context, and the harness. The harness orchestrates the model and context by bringing context into the model window at the right time. Developers can customize harnesses using middleware constructs like hooks and plugins to add capabilities such as sandboxes, file systems, sub-agents, and memory. Evals and observability platforms like Harbor and LangSmith power a continuous learning data flywheel to improve agent performance over time.

## Key Takeaways

- An agent harness orchestrates a model and some context by bringing context to the model at the right point in time.
- The core agent architecture runs an LLM in a loop that calls tools and feeds observations back into the loop.
- Developers can customize a simple harness loop using middleware constructs like code snippets, hooks, and plugins.
- Start with a general off-the-shelf harness, then add custom gates, checks, or middleware as you narrow in on your specific use case.
- Evals, private benchmarks, and detailed observability traces are necessary to debug agent failures and power a continuous learning data flywheel.

Harnesses. I think this is a very
important topic. A lot of you are
thinking through building your own
harnesses right now. Um, I'm very
excited to introduce Harrison. I first
noticed Harrison on Twitter in 2022,
back in the GPT-3 era. And Harrison was
one of the first people thinking about,
"Okay, we have these models. How can we
build an entire harness around them so
that they're not just um auto-complete
uh tasks, but that they start acting as
virtual collaborators or agents?" Um and
Harrison, like the ecosystem has grown
so much since 2022, and I've seen you
you also grow a lot in terms of how you
think about building agents, building
harnesses, how to eval them, etc. Um so,
I'm very excited to have you talk today.
I think the talk's going to be both
about harnesses and evals. And then
format again will be 15 minutes or so of
presentation content, uh 15 minutes of
Q&A. Thanks for joining us, Harrison.
>> Cool. Um my name's Harrison, co-founder
CEO of LangChain. I want to talk about
evals and harnesses in the context of
kind of owning your own intelligence.
So, when we talk about intelligence,
we're normally talking about agents.
What exactly makes up an agent? At
LangChain, we think there's kind of like
three main parts. There's a harness that
orchestrates a model and some context.
And if you're talking about owning your
intelligence in general, you probably
want to own all three parts of these.
And so, owning the model, I'm not going
to talk too much about. Lin was here
from Fireworks and talking about open
weight models and owning that. Uh big
part of this is also the ability to
switch models. Uh
there used to be this concept of kind of
being like cloud agnostic and being able
to switch clouds uh back in the day.
Same thing exists, but for models. You
want to be able to switch to avoid
lock-in, but also to just use the best
model when it's available. Context, you
want to own all the the context that
your agent uses. Whether that is memory,
uh whether that is semantic knowledge,
um whether that is previous
conversations. You can these can help
personalize and guide the agent as it
goes along. And then the last bit is the
harness, and that's what I really want
to focus on.
So, how how do you how do you really own
your harness? What does that even mean?
What's the main job of a harness? The
main job of a harness is to bring
context to the model at the right point
in time.
And so, it does all the orchestration
around the the fixed context, the the
dynamic context. It brings it into the
context window of the model, shows it
something, gets some response, and then
does something with that.
And so, agents need to do all these
different things in order to accomplish
their jobs. There's a ton of
domain-specific stuff that they need to
do as well, but they need to interact
with external systems. These external
systems, when you interact with them,
they emit more context that can get fed
back into the agent into the loop. And
so, the harness is the thing that really
orchestrates all of this together.
Agents at [snorts] their their kind of
like simplest, when everyone talks about
agents, what they really talk about is
just an LLM running in a loop calling
tools.
Um and uh this this is a really simple,
but really general architecture. Some
request comes in, the the LLM makes some
uh generation. That generation may
include a tool to call. If it does, you
invoke those tools, and you pass that
observation back to the LLM. And and
this is this is the core architecture
behind pretty much every agent out there
today.
But they're all different in like
slightly different ways. And so, on the
left here, this is kind of like uh the
the the base core kind of like loop. But
there's a bunch of different things that
you can do in your particular harness at
different stages.
And so, this is uh over here, this is
So, so we built LangChain, which is a
really really base minimal harness, and
that's LangChain over here. And then
this is Deep Agents. Deep Agents is kind
of like our model-agnostic and and more
general-purpose version of of Quad Code.
And so, it does more things. It connects
to file systems. Uh it has skills. It
has sub-agents.
It's built on top of this really simple
harness, but we customize it by using
these uh these levers over here. So, you
can run particular code snippets before
the agent's invoked, before each model
call. You can kind of like wrap these
model calls, you can wrap the tool
calls, and you can and you can customize
this core uh simple loop in a lot of
really powerful ways just by just by
using kind of like small what we call
kind of like middleware constructs.
There's other ways to customize the
harness as well, but this is kind of
emerged as uh there's a concept of hooks
and plugins in a lot of the coding
agents as well, and that's essentially
what they're doing. They're taking this
base loop that's running, and they're
adding little hooks or plugins at
various points to let you customize it.
And so, a lot of the stuff that you can
do when you can customize, this is all
done by that concept of middleware, by
just modifying that core loop. So, the
agent's still running in a loop, it's
still doing that same simple
architecture, but through that you can
give it access to a sandbox, you can
give it access to a file system, you can
give it access to sub-agents, you can
give it access to to memory, you can
have summarizations. So, summarization,
if if if we go back to this thing,
summarization would come in before the
model. Before the model's invoked, you
check if the context is too long, and
then you summarize it. And so, that that
you can add into this core loop through
this concept of middleware, same with
context offloading,
um which which is a way of basically
taking large tool calls and dumping
them. That kind of wraps the tool call.
And so, the point is there's there's
this really simple kind of like general
architecture of an agent. All of these
more advanced agent harnesses are
basically doing that loop, but adding in
a bunch of stuff while still running the
core loop. And so, as you think about
kind of like building or customizing
your own harness,
these are the different places that you
can insert things into. You can add your
own summarization step, you can add your
own handling of particular tool calls,
and that's one way that you can
customize kind of like the agent to your
particular domain and the harness to
your particular domain.
The other way that you can customize the
harnesses that the agent runs in is by
having a more explicit kind of like
cognitive
So, this used to be the way that a lot
of people would build agents in kind of
2023, 2024 because the models weren't
good enough to run in a loop. And so, in
order to get it to do particular things,
you would have these very bespoke
cognitive architectures. And so, this
one over here is
for
a deep research example
where it would generate some some sub
questions, fan them out, and then go and
execute them. And then this one over
here is for a code review bot. And you
can see that there's these very kind of
like the bespoke steps.
A lot of this has gone into the harness
now. And by the harness, I mean it's
still this core loop. These might be
added as particular kind of like
modifications to that core loop. But,
for a lot of really particular kind of
like flows, we do see people still using
cognitive architectures like these to
really guide it in particular ways. One
thing that we recommend to people is to
start with a general harness.
That's the easiest to get started. It's
going to be quickest to time to value.
And then as you kind of narrow in on the
use case that you want to be excellent
at, you can start to add more of these
kind of like gates and checks around it
to to to guide it into particular ways.
One question that we get a lot is when
to kind of think about building your own
harness versus using an off-the-shelf
harness. Um a lot of the off-the-shelf
harnesses are uh work with particular
models. So, the off-the-shelf harnesses
include things like Claude Code or
Claude Agent SDK, which works with
Anthropic models, Codex, which works
with OpenAI models. I think this is a
big open question in the industry. My
answer generally is the more in
distribution you are of what the models
are trained on, then the better the
off-the-shelf harness will be. As soon
as you start to move further and further
out of distribution, then the then
you'll probably want to tune your
harness in some way.
There's different ways to tune the
harness as well. So, the models may be
in distribution on particular things
that you are doing on an out of
distribution task. So, what I mean by
that is if you think about something
like like legal AI, which Gabe just
talked about, and I think he mentioned
how they have their own harness,
there are things that are in legal AI
that are still in distribution of the
the the main models. So, for example,
editing files is something that the main
models have all been RL'd on. And
they've actually all been RL'd in very
particular ways. So, OpenAI and and
Claude models edit files in in different
ways in their harnesses, and as a
result, their models are actually best
at editing files in different ways.
Now, the the models themselves are out
of distribution on this larger task of
legal AI, but they're in distribution on
this task of editing files. So, if you
think about building a harness that
works there, you'll probably want a
custom harness, but you'll want it to
use the edit file tool that is in
distribution for
the the the model that you're using. So,
one of the things we do in Deep Agents,
for example, so Deep Agents is our
customizable harness, we actually have
this concept of model profiles, where
for things that are in distribution of
models like editing files, we basically
switch between different edit file
implementations depending on which
model's being used. And so, I think
that's an example of customizing the
overall harness when it's out of
distribution for a task, but keeping
smaller in distribution parts
as close to the model layer as as
possible.
The second big part of what I want to
talk about is evals and observability.
And so, I think as you're experimenting
with all parts of an agent, whether it's
the model or the harness or the context,
you're going to want to know what's
going on inside of this system, and
you're going to want to be able to
evaluate it. And so, these are useful
tools that you can use, again, not just
for custom harnesses, but also for
custom models.
So, there was a great Twitter article
that Satya wrote uh
2 weeks ago,
um where he talked about a lot of these
concepts. And there's three quotes in
particular that kind of stood out for
me. One, create your private evals
because eval defines what good looks
like inside the organization. Two,
retain ownership of your organization's
memory, traces, feedback, though that
bold is mine, decisions, and
institutional context. And then three,
you create your own continuous learning
loop hill climbing machine that will
allow your AI investments to compound
the value of your firm. And so I think
these speak to the importance of evals
and observability and the learning loop
that they power in in really owning your
intelligence and compounding it. So how
exactly do they do that?
So evals. Gabe was here talking about
how they built benchmarks for the legal
domain. I think every company what when
they're building a mission-critical
agent, they will build benchmarks for
that agent.
Um you can use it to define and catch
regressions or you can hill climb on
that benchmark. Again, either by
adjusting the harness or adjusting the
model.
Things that we see becoming the industry
standard for defining these benchmarks
is Harbor. Harbor is an open-source eval
runner. It's uh created by the makers of
Terminal Bench 2, which is one of the
industry standard benchmarks for
benchmarking coding agents, and it's
become pretty popular for a variety of
domains.
What it lets you do, so this is so this
is Frontier Bench, which is another uh
coding benchmark. You get this nice
benchmark and you can compare different
agent harnesses, different models,
different reasoning efforts, and you can
get this nice benchmark and you can see
how all these different harnesses and
all these different models do on your
task. And so having a benchmark for your
task will become really really important
when you're trying to define it.
What exactly is Harbor? It's pretty
simple. At a high level, it consists of
agent that you you run an agent against
the data set. A data set has a bunch of
different tasks. Generally, they're run
in sandboxes because they are a lot of
these different tasks and you might want
to parallelize them. And as we talk as I
talk about in a little bit, each task
has its own kind of like environment. So
this is what a Harbor task looks like.
So, on the right, you can see that it
has an environment. This is where you
define the environment that the agent
runs in. A lot of these longer running,
more stateful agents need to interact
with their environment. And so, you
basically spin up a sandbox, give it its
own environment that's defined in a
Dockerfile, and run it there.
There's then uh a solution, which is
basically this this is uh a kind of like
golden solution that you use to sanity
check it, so it's not that interesting.
Test is more interesting. This is
basically the verifier for the the agent
run.
The test scripts can do anything. They
can run code, they can run unit tests,
they can run another LLM as a judge,
they can run an agent as a judge. You
basically define how the agent is scored
in this test. And then instruction.md is
the prompt that the agent is given. And
that's kind of like the core of Harbor.
You define these tasks, which are
bundled up things that can be run in a
sandbox, and then you run a bunch of
them against agents. And agents again
consist of models and harnesses, and you
score how how they do.
When you do all of that, what do you
get? You get some nice results that you
can compare. So, this is LangSmith, the
the platform that we build for evals and
observability. And so, you can see here
a bunch of different experiments. Uh we
have a great integration with Harbor.
You can see the the feedback scores. In
this case, it's a single reward
function. You can also track latency and
tokens. So, when you're benchmarking
agents, you probably don't just care
about accuracy. You also probably care
about latency and and and cost. And so,
you'll want to track all of those.
And then for a particular experiment
that you run, these are these would be
the different tasks that are in a in a
in a Harbor data set.
Talking about a little bit about
observability. Uh observability sounds
basic, but I think it's really important
and really underrated for agents,
actually. So, when agents mess up, they
mess up because an LLM call goes wrong.
Why might it go wrong? It might go wrong
for one of two reasons. One, the model
is not good enough. Two, the context
that the LLM received isn't good enough.
And so, I actually think it's the the
second one that more often than not
causes issues. And so, having really
good observability into what is going
into the context window of the the model
and then how that context is
accumulated, what steps were run, what
tools were run, how does that context
get there? All of that is really
important for debugging your agent when
it when it goes wrong.
So this is one view of observability
that we have. This is intended to be a
more kind of like user-friendly view
where we actually represent it. This is
similar to what you might see in kind of
like Claude code. We we kind of like
hide some of the tool calls so you can
see seven tool calls up there.
And so we try to make it really easy to
kind of like skim through this. Most
agent paths these days come in the form
of trajectories. Trajectories are
basically you can think of them as the
list of messages that you see kind of
like Claude code running. So when you
run Claude code or another agent, you
type in a human message, it then makes a
bunch of tool calls. Those are all
messages under the hood and then it
responds and then you type in another
human message. That's kind of like this
message trajectory that is becoming more
and more of a central part of of these
agents. But that's not enough to fully
debug it and so we also have this full
kind of like trace and you can click
into particular things and see exactly
what goes on inside the model. And this
type of observability is pretty
important for knowing what's going on.
Evals and observability really let you
set up this data flywheel and compound
the intelligence as you as you start to
use the agent, as your users start to
use the agent and you start to get
feedback.
So this is this is a slide that one of
our team members presented at Swyx's AI
engineering fair actually around a
recipe for continuously improving
agents.
At a high-level it's really simple. You
build an agent, you start running it,
you collect lots of traces, you then
curate the trace data, and then you run
experiments on on that data that you
create. And so it's really simple,
but of course there's a lot of
complexity under the hood. So so one
thing that's really important for this
is is feedback. Getting feedback either
from the environment or from synthetic
source. So from the environment, one
thing that I think is really
underestimated in agent design is
actually UX design of how you present
the agent to your users. If you present
it in a really intelligent way, you can
actually end up getting a lot of
feedback from them. They may not click
thumbs up or thumbs down explicitly. No
one really doing that. But if you if you
design the UX in a clever way, you can
get some of that feedback. The other
thing you can do is you can start to get
synthetic feedback. So you can run what
we call kind of like online evaluators
over these traces to judge things. So
Gabe was talking about an experiment
that we did with Harvey where we we
significantly reduced the cost of some
of these LLM as a judge type thing. So
if you imagine running Opus over every
single trace that comes into your
system, that's going to rack up a big
bill. And so you want a really cheap and
fast way of doing this. So we've
fine-tuned some SLMs for actually doing
this, but you can of course use
off-the-shelf models with custom
prompting to do it. Or you can just use
code if some of the things that you want
to test are are simple enough.
Um so this is the the the full a part of
it. Um the curating the trace data,
feedback is a big part there. And then
the other thing is is when you use that
data to update what happens, you can
update any part of the agent with this
with this kind of like system. Um so you
can update the harness by doing harness
engineering. You can update the model by
do a by doing fine-tuning on that. You
can update the context by doing memory.
Um and and so the part that we are that
we think most about at LangChain is the
harness engineering part of that. And so
I want to show a really quick demo of of
one of the things that we added to help
with that. But I I think Trajectory is
talking next on some fine-tuning that
can be done. Uh and and so it's a very
similar process where you run the agent,
get some traces, use that data in some
way to improve the system. What is the
system? It's these three pieces. Any of
these can be updated in some way.
Um and so yeah, this is the full
end-to-end um
uh uh flow that you might want to do.
One of the things that we think about is
how can you automate this as much as
possible because this is tricky and
takes a lot of time.
Um and so that's one of the things that
we've been thinking about for the past
few months. I want to do a quick demo of
what we call LangSmith Engine, uh which
is basically an agent that sits on top
of your traces and does all this work.
So if we look at what that work was, you
know, you've got these traces, it's it
the work from there is curating the
traces and running some experiments,
suggesting fixes to one of the three
things. And as I mentioned, we mostly
focus on the harness engineering bit. Um
so uh in the demo I want to show uh what
this looks like and how it represents
that. So hopefully this will work. If
not, it's not that big of a deal.
Perfect. Okay. So this is LangSmith.
This is a bunch of traces we have coming
in. Um we have this tab called engine
over here. Um this is an agent. It runs
in the background. It creates what we
call kind of like issue boards. So this
is the part of curating data. It will
look for It will It will It will
basically under the hood is a coding
agent that has access to our LangSmith
CLI. The LangSmith CLI, you can filter
traces for feedback and other things
like that. So we give it a nice big
prompt and some sub-agents that help it
basically go out and explore this data
and identify issues and see what common
things are. And then it will create
these issues right here. And so here um
it's created an issue. It gives a
description of it. It has It links to
the traces so I can go see some
supporting evidence. And then down here,
I guess this is very simple changes to
the prompts. Um but here it's updating
part of uh of the context in this case.
Um here it's also updating some
instructions. Um and we can see here
that it's adding uh some code to go into
the harness as well. And so this is uh
something we launched in the past few uh
months and I think speaks to this data
flywheel, which again is a very simple
thing. Run agent, get traces,
see patterns, fix. Um and and this is
our attempt at automating it. Um, that's
all I've got. Happy to take any
questions on harnesses or evals.
>> Um, this is great, by the way. Really
appreciate the whole whole presentation.
Uh, Engine itself is an agent, right?
That's given a prompt and go search over
things. Uh, have you run Engine on
Engine?
>> We have it running, yeah. So, we got
slight So, Engine also hooks up to Slack
and sends it kind of like reports about
itself. Um, and yeah, that's how we
that's how we dogfood it. Yeah.
We also uh we also created uh
uh what we call kind of like issue bench
for Engine, which again is like a harbor
a harbor formatted uh
uh
benchmark, basically, that we're
constantly benchmarking different models
and different harnesses on.
Um, and so, it's
I think Gabe talked about this a little
bit, but one of the benefits of having a
benchmark is you can you can benchmark
it on a bunch of different harnesses and
see what they're good and bad at. So, we
we uh I think a few weeks ago we ran our
our own kind of like deep agents and
then Codex and then Claude Code on this.
And we saw that Codex was doing a really
interesting thing, where it would write
itself a bunch of small scripts to run
against these traces, and it was doing
that really aggressively and actually
allowing it to perform really well. So,
we we did a sprint to do what we call
the kind of like codis- codexification
of Engine and basically take that
learning and and bring it into kind of
like the the core Engine harness. And
so, I think that's another uh a benefit
of having a benchmark is you can just
run a bunch of different things on it
and see how they actually perform and
then bring those things back into your
core kind of like agent harness.
>> Super cool talk. Um, to which extent do
you think that like harnesses will
converge into one thing and users will
be educated to do that and the models
will be best for that versus
diversifying here, every company has
their own
uh way of doing things uh optimized for
them?
>> Yeah. Yeah, really good question, one
that we think a lot about. And um, I I
chatted with Eno from Factory, who also
kind of like thinks a lot about this.
Um, and and I think there's some stuff
we talked about this.
Um,
I I think
uh
I think there's
I I think the model I I don't know is
the is the honest answer. I think uh
some things that I've seen is that the
general purpose harnesses have gotten
good enough to work for a lot of basic
tasks at least when you're getting
started. So, I would recommend getting
started with like an off-the-shelf
harness, whether it's Deep Agents or
Codex or Cloud Code or something like
that. Because I think the models are now
good enough and the things that we've
learned about what these makes these
models good, access to file systems,
sub-agents, things like that, those are
those those are kind of like good
enough. Um, I think we often see that
the more out of distribution you get,
the more you're going to want to
customize the harness. And it's a scale,
right? So, like it uh it it it it at the
extreme end of a scale, you might want
to build a complete kind of like
cognitive architecture that that is
really focused on things. A A reason
Another reason you might want to do
that, by the way, is kind of like for
predictability and control. And so, we
have a lot of customers in financial
services where they want where they need
kind of like predictability. And so,
they we show them something like Deep
Agents and they're like, "Woah, woah,
woah. That's way too like scary an agent
for us. We want like more of this kind
of like custom cognitive architecture
where we can really control things." Um,
but but then on the other end, uh you
know, you could just use an
off-the-shelf harness and there's things
in the middle like hooks or middleware
that you can use to kind of So, so it's
a spectrum as well. The more out of
distribution you get, the more custom
harness you're going to want to have.
Um, and then there's other like weird
things where like again, like um, I I I
think uh both OpenAI and Anthropic are
getting really good at coding, but
they've landed on different ways to kind
of like edit files um that are like, you
know,
that are like actually pretty different.
Um, you know, I I think they have some
benchmark and I think he was uh he he
thought that one way was just better
than the other way just like strictly
superior
and and so that's like like
so I think the model labs will kind of
converge and that they all seem to be
kind of like really good at coding the
harnesses will converge to to kind of
like being really good at coding if they
keep on going down that path but they're
at the same time there are these like
really small differences and I don't
really know how to explain those either
and and
right now I think those show up most
concretely in small things but you could
imagine what what if one lab really goes
down kind of like bio and those
harnesses become really good at kind of
like bio agent things then then then the
harnesses themselves start to diverge
and so
I I I don't know is the answer to the
fast moving space that's why evals and
observability are important and I think
and and I think we
to measure all of that.
Cool. Awesome. Thank you guys.
